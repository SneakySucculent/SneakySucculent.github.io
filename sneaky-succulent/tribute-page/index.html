        <h2>What defines an amphibian?</h2>
        <p>There is much that can be said to define amphibians.  But from a very broad overview amphibians are vertabrets that are typically born from eggs in the water and undergo some form of metamorphisis then live on land.  As with most things, there are exceptions and further, more precise definitions, but that's the broad definition.  All extant amphibians fall under one of three orders:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anura (Frogs & Toads)</li>
          <li>Urodela (Salamanders & Newts)</li>
          <li>Gymnophiona (Caecilians)</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="anura" class="order">
          <h2>Anura</h2>
          <!--Image from Hans on pixabay at https://pixabay.com/photos/frog-hollow-of-a-tree-frog-4136562/-->

          <p>Frogs and toads are, perhaps, the most widely known amphibians being found commonly all over the world and containing about 7,300 species.  Both frogs and toads begin life as tadpoles, hatching from eggs in bodies of water, eventually growing legs still in the water, and then more legs and they begin living on land.</p>
          <h3>Frogs vs Toads</h3>
          <p>While there is much talk about the difference between frogs and toads, it's actually a rectangle and square situation: all true toads are frogs but not all frogs are toads!  That being said, there are some key differences between the two.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Toads lay their eggs in long strands, whereas frogs lay eggs in clusters</li>
            <li>Toads have drier, rougher looking skin than frogs</li>
            <li>Toads are always poisonous, but not all frogs are poisonous</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is so, so, so much more that could be said about the beings that make up the order anura, but we still have two more orders to get to!  If you would like to learn a bit more about toads and frogs, you can do so <a href="https://toadsnfrogs.com/" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">here</a> at toads n frogs, created by a master herpetologist!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="urodela" class="order">
          <h2>Urodela</h2>
          <!--Image from LaDameBucolique on pixabay at https://pixabay.com/photos/axolotl-melanotic-black-male-2193310/-->
          <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/01/10/22/axolotl-2193310_960_720.jpg" alt="An axolotl">
          <p>The order Urodela contains all extant (currently living) amphibians that have lizard-like bodies.  These are what we would call salamnaders and newts.  Much like toads and frogs, all newts are salamanders but not all salamanders are newts.  Both salamanders and newts have aquatic larvae that move onto land, but there are some differences.</p>
          <h3>Differences between Newts and Salamanders</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Newts are typically more aquatic than salamanders, the later being mostly terestrial</li>
            <li>Newts develop lungs when they move onto land, but most salamanders breath through their skin</li>
            <li>Newts have webbed feet and a paddle tail to aid with swimming, where as salamanders are most often built for digging on land</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Axolotols</h3>
          <p>Axolotols are one of the more well known salamanders, and also one of the more prominent exceptions to many of the urodela features.  They are a neotenic salamander, meaning they retain their juvenile form.  As such, they spend all their lives in the water, despite growing lungs.</p>

          <h2>Gymnophiona</h2>
          <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffactanimal.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F05%2Fcaecilian.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=7ec9f8552c12b5615a6cc1e2b5de0b0410422f391cf6e87bd3f5171a4cf7dbb8&ipo=images" alt="A caecilian">
          <p>The order Gymnophiona is the least known and least well known group amphibians, containing the caecilians.  The caecilian gets its name from the latin "caecus" due to their amount of eyes: little to none.  They have worm or snake like bodies, no limbs, they have either no eyes or very small eyes under their skin.  They spend most of their time underground or in the water, and as such their eyes, if they have any, can only tell the difference between light and the absence there of.  They are also the only amphibian that has tentacles!  These are found between their snout and eyes (if present) and are most likely used for tactile sensation.</p>
          <p>As previously mentioned, not a lot is known about caecilians.  This is due in part to them living underground where it is hard to find them.  As such, scientists have only found 10 species of caecilian.</p>
          <p>Caecilians are strange, caecilians are unknown, caecilians are loved.</p>
